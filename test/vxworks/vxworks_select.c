* selServer - reads data as it becomes available from two different pipes
*
* Opens two pipe fds, reading from whichever becomes available. The
* server code assumes the pipes have been created from either another
* task or the shell. To test this code from the shell do the following:
* -> ld < selServer.o
* -> pipeDevCreate ("/pipe/highPriority", 5, 1024)
* -> pipeDevCreate ("/pipe/normalPriority", 5, 1024)
* -> fdHi = open ("/pipe/highPriority", 1, 0)
* -> fdNorm = open ("/pipe/normalPriority", 1, 0)
* -> iosFdShow
* -> sp selServer
* -> i
* At this point you should see selServerâ€™s state as pended. You can now
* write to either pipe to make the selServer display your message.
* -> write fdNorm, "Howdy", 6
* -> write fdHi, "Urgent", 7
